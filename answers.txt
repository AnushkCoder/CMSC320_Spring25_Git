Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: 
The difference between merging and rebasing lies in how they integrate changes from one branch into another:

Merging: Combines the histories of two branches, creating a new "merge commit" that includes all changes from both branches. This preserves the full commit history and results in a non-linear history.

Rebasing: Moves or "re-applies" commits from one branch onto another, rewriting the commit history to create a linear sequence of changes. It avoids the merge commit, making the history cleaner but potentially losing context of the original branch structure.
