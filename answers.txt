Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer:Git is useful because it helps manage and track changes in projects, especially when multiple people are working together.
 It allows us to go back to previous versions of our work, preventing loss of data.
 It’s a reliable and efficient tool for collaboration and maintaining organized project histories.




Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

For example, in healthcare, data science is used to analyze patient data and predict disease outbreaks, treatment outcomes, or identify patterns in patient conditions. This helps in improving patient care and decision-making in medical practices.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: 
The difference between merging and rebasing lies in how they integrate changes from one branch into another:

Merging: Combines the histories of two branches, creating a new "merge commit" that includes all changes from both branches. This preserves the full commit history and results in a non-linear history.

Rebasing: Moves or "re-applies" commits from one branch onto another, rewriting the commit history to create a linear sequence of changes. It avoids the merge commit, making the history cleaner but potentially losing context of the original branch structure.




Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: This semester, I’m looking forward to diving deeper into new topics and building more hands-on experience. 
I’m excited about collaborating with classmates on projects, learning from professors, and tackling challenging assignments that will help me grow academically and professionally.
